# Jaslist Ticket Marketplace dApp

## Overview
### Problem
Second-hand ticket exchanges (for concerts, events, shows, etc.) are vulnerable to scams because the buyer or the seller is not a trusted source. Tickets need to be validated for their authenticity and promised that they aren't duplicated. Funds from the buyer need to be validated. 

### Solution
Jaslist Ticket Marketplace dApp will allow users to buy or sell tickets and can engage in transactions where the ticket and money exchange are verified on the blockchain.
